    "action": "<p>Having reviewed the number of calls received from the community this year compared to last year as well as on-going patrols there is a noticeable reduction in both persistent begging and homeless persons in and around the Narborough Rd and surrounding areas. We have completed numerous referrals to housing, shelter and Turning Point organisations to provide help and support those people in need. We have given verbal and written warnings to those identified as causing public nuisance by persistent or aggressive begging as well as liaising with both the local residential and business communities around this issue. Thank you for your on-going support and please continue to report any issues to your local Police Team. Sgt Dyer</p>",
